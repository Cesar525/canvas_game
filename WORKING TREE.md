IDEAS
build a monster system that is easier to make them.
Example
const Monsters= {
        Bukara = {
                name : "Bukara",
                Gun : "Space pistol",
                sprite: "path/path.png",
                Health : 10000,
                Boss : true,
                Speed : 10,
                Damage : 300,
                addGun  = {
                        addGun : true,
                        Show_shottingFrom : false  // thi sis to show where the shot is gonna come from.
                        shot_one  = {
                                posx : 0,
                                posy : 0
                        }
                        shot_one  = {
                                posx : 0,
                                posy : 0
                        }
                        shot_one  = {
                                posx : 0,
                                posy : 0
                        }
                speed_Change = {
                        speedChange : true,
                        Speed : 30,
                        onHealth : 3000,
                        ShottingSpeedChangeInterval  : 
                }                   
        }
}
}
 



ATTENTION : The only item that wil be use right away when the player have contact with it would be the
PowerBomb Energy. Once player touch that it will automaticly increase his powerBomb bar.
